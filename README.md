## ***Picture Memory Game***

###  ***Picture Memory Game***

- There will be 25 different pictures pairs opn cards.
    - Each picture will have a pair (2) and be place on cards. 
    - The cards will be randomly designated.
    - Spread across the board.

- Once the game has started and the cards have been layed out in a randomized way they will stay in that spot until they have been paired.
    - At the begging of the game the player will click 2 cards.
        - Once clicked the card will turn over.
        - The player will either find a pair or not.
        - Finding a pair will remove those cards from the board and add one to the players score, then that same player will be give another turn.
        - If no pair the next player will now beging their turn repeating the pervious steps. 
    - The paired cards will be removed from the board and the area the card was in will be left blank.
    - Each player will have 2 clicks per turn.
        - After every turn if the players do not find a pair.
        - The cards they exposed will be shown and then turned back over 5 seconds after the second clicked card.
    - When all cards have been paired another screen will pop up with the winner and a button to either end the game or restart another game. 
    - Once the game has ended it will tally the scored and keep track of how many times you lost or won.
    - You can click a button next to the tally to completely wipe the score to start over.
